# Python Sorting Algorithms

This Python script demonstrates three fundamental sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort. It generates a random array of integers and then sorts this array using each of the three algorithms, printing the array after each operation to show the progress of the sort.

## Libraries Used

- `time`: This library is not used in the current version of the script, but it can be used to measure the time it takes for each sorting algorithm to run, which can be useful for comparing their performance.

- `random`: This library is used to generate the random array of integers that the script sorts. The `randint` function is used to generate each individual integer.

## Functions

- `print_array(arr)`: This function prints the elements of the array `arr` in a single line, separated by spaces.

- `bubble_sort(arr)`: This function sorts the array `arr` using the Bubble Sort algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

- `insertion_sort(arr)`: This function sorts the array `arr` using the Insertion Sort algorithm. It builds a sorted array one item at a time, with the remaining items left unsorted.

- `selection_sort(arr)`: This function sorts the array `arr` using the Selection Sort algorithm. It divides the input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the smallest element and moving that to the sorted region.

- `main()`: This is the main function that generates the random array and calls the sorting functions. It first prints the original unsorted array, then prints the array after each sort operation.

## Usage

To run the script, simply execute it with a Python interpreter. The script does not take any command line arguments. The size of the array and the range of the random integers can be adjusted by modifying the `size` variable and the arguments to `randint` in the `main` function.

# C# Documentation

# Bubble Sort Algorithm in CSharp

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm in CSharp. The script sorts an array of integers in ascending order.

## Script Explanation

The script consists of a `Main` method where an array of integers is defined and the `bubbleSort` method is called to sort the array. The sorted array is then printed to the console using the `printArray` method.

## Imported Libraries

The script uses the following libraries:

- `System`: This is a built-in C# library that provides fundamental classes and base classes that define commonly-used value and reference data types, events and event handlers, interfaces, attributes, and processing exceptions.

## Code Breakdown

- `bubbleSort(int[] arr)`: This method implements the Bubble Sort algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

- `printArray(int[] arr)`: This method prints the elements of the array to the console. It iterates through the array and writes each element followed by a space.

## Usage

To run the script, you need a C# compiler. You can use the one provided by the .NET framework. Once you have the .NET framework installed, you can compile and run the script using the following commands:

```bash
csc Program.cs
./Program.exe
```

This will print the sorted array to the console.

# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This repository contains a Java script for a Sorting Algorithm Visualizer. Due to the limitations of a text-based environment, it's not possible to create a visualizer console application in Java. This kind of application would require a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize the sorting process, which cannot be done in a console application.

## Description

The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a tool that helps users understand how different sorting algorithms work by visualizing the process of sorting an array of numbers. The script uses various sorting algorithms and displays each step of the sorting process, allowing users to see how the array changes over time.

## Imported Libraries

The script may import the following libraries:

1. **java.util.Arrays**: This library is used for handling arrays in Java. It provides numerous methods for manipulating arrays (such as sorting and searching).

2. **java.awt.Graphics**: This library is used to create graphical components. It provides classes for creating various GUI components like buttons, text fields, checkboxes, etc.

3. **javax.swing.JFrame**: This library is used to create a window where the sorting visualization will be displayed. It provides functionalities for creating and managing windows.

Please note that the actual imported libraries may vary depending on the specific requirements of the script.

## Usage

To use the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer, you need to run the script in an environment that supports Java and GUI applications. Follow the instructions provided in the script to choose the sorting algorithm and start the visualization.
